# Solution Summary: Add Missing Utility Module for shadcn Components

## Problem

PR #8 added shadcn/ui components (`button.tsx`, `card.tsx`, `avatar.tsx`) to the `frontend-v2` directory. All these components import the `cn` utility function from `@/lib/utils`, but this file did not exist in the repository. This would cause TypeScript compilation to fail with:

```
Cannot find module '@/lib/utils' or its corresponding type declarations
```

## Solution

Created the missing `frontend-v2/lib/utils.ts` file with the standard shadcn/ui utility implementation.

### Files Added

1. **`frontend-v2/lib/utils.ts`** (6 lines)
   - Contains the `cn` function that combines `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`
   - Used by all shadcn/ui components for intelligent CSS class merging
   
2. **`frontend-v2/lib/README.md`** (64 lines)
   - Documentation explaining the utility module
   - Usage examples
   - Dependency information

### Files Modified

1. **`.gitignore`**
   - Added exception `!frontend-v2/lib/` to allow the lib directory
   - The root .gitignore had `lib/` to ignore Python library directories, which was also catching our frontend lib

## Implementation Details

The `cn` function implementation:

```typescript
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```

This is the standard shadcn/ui utility that:
- Uses `clsx` for conditional class name composition
- Uses `tailwind-merge` to intelligently merge Tailwind CSS classes and prevent conflicts

## Verification

1. **TypeScript Compilation**: 
   - Ran `npx tsc --noEmit` and confirmed 0 errors related to `@/lib/utils`
   - All shadcn components can now successfully import the utility

2. **Import Resolution**:
   - Verified that `@/lib/utils` correctly resolves via the `@/*` path mapping in `tsconfig.json`
   - Tested with all three shadcn components (button, card, avatar)

3. **Security**:
   - Ran CodeQL security check: 0 vulnerabilities found
   - No dependencies were added (clsx and tailwind-merge already in package.json)

## Dependencies

No new dependencies were added. The solution uses existing packages:
- `clsx@2.1.1` (already in package.json)
- `tailwind-merge@3.3.1` (already in package.json)

## Impact

This fix unblocks the Next.js migration (PR #8) and allows:
- TypeScript compilation to succeed
- All shadcn/ui components to function properly
- Future shadcn components to use the same utility

## Testing Recommendations

When PR #8 is merged:
1. Run `npm install` in the `frontend-v2` directory
2. Run `npm run build` to verify Next.js build succeeds
3. Run `npm run dev` to test the development server
4. Verify all shadcn components render correctly
