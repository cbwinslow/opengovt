# [OpenDiscourse] Fine-tune BERT Models on Political Text

**Project Item Category**: Medium Term

**Priority**: Medium

**Estimated Effort**: Large (> 2 weeks)

## Description

Train custom BERT models specifically on political and legislative text for better accuracy in downstream tasks like sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and classification. Pre-trained models may not capture the nuances of political language.

## Tasks

- [ ] Collect and curate political text corpus (bills, speeches, debates)
- [ ] Clean and preprocess training data
- [ ] Set up training infrastructure (GPU cluster or cloud)
- [ ] Choose base model (BERT, RoBERTa, or ELECTRA)
- [ ] Implement training pipeline with HuggingFace Transformers
- [ ] Fine-tune on masked language modeling task
- [ ] Evaluate perplexity and downstream task performance
- [ ] Fine-tune on specific tasks (sentiment, NER, classification)
- [ ] Deploy fine-tuned models to model registry
- [ ] Update analysis modules to use new models
- [ ] Benchmark against baseline models
- [ ] Document training process and results

## Dependencies

- `transformers` library (already installed)
- `torch` or `tensorflow` (already installed)
- GPU infrastructure (NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA)
- Large political text corpus (10-100M+ words)
- Cloud storage for model checkpoints
- MLflow or similar for experiment tracking

## Success Criteria

- Fine-tuned model shows improved performance on political text
- Model achieves lower perplexity than base BERT
- Downstream tasks (sentiment, NER) show accuracy improvements
- Training pipeline is reproducible and documented
- Models are versioned and accessible
- Computational costs are reasonable
- Legal and ethical considerations are addressed

## Additional Context

Training corpus sources:
- Congressional Record (decades of debates)
- Bill texts from Congress.gov and OpenStates
- Speeches from political events
- Committee hearings transcripts

Training considerations:
- Estimated 50-100 GPU hours on V100 or A100
- Cost: $200-500 on cloud GPU services
- Data licensing and copyright issues
- Bias in training data needs careful handling

Evaluation metrics:
- Perplexity on held-out political text
- Accuracy on political sentiment classification
- F1 score on political entity recognition
- Comparison with domain-adapted models (e.g., political-twitter-bert)
