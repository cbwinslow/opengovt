# [OpenDiscourse] Implement Topic Modeling (LDA, BERTopic)

**Project Item Category**: Short Term

**Priority**: High

**Estimated Effort**: Medium (1-2 weeks)

## Description

Add topic modeling capabilities to automatically categorize and cluster bills by subject matter. This will enable discovery of themes, trends, and related legislation across time periods and jurisdictions.

## Tasks

- [ ] Install and configure gensim for LDA implementation
- [ ] Implement LDA topic modeling in new `analysis/topic_modeling.py` module
- [ ] Add BERTopic integration for transformer-based topic modeling
- [ ] Create database tables for topic assignments and metadata
- [ ] Add topic visualization tools (pyLDAvis or similar)
- [ ] Implement topic labeling and interpretation
- [ ] Create example script `examples/topic_modeling_example.py`
- [ ] Add SQL queries for topic-based analysis
- [ ] Update documentation with topic modeling usage

## Dependencies

- `gensim` - for LDA implementation
- `bertopic` - for transformer-based topic modeling
- `pyLDAvis` - for interactive topic visualization
- `scikit-learn` - for preprocessing and vectorization
- PostgreSQL tables for storing topics

## Success Criteria

- LDA successfully identifies coherent topics in legislative corpus
- BERTopic provides high-quality topic clusters
- Topics can be assigned to bills and stored in database
- Visualization tools allow interactive exploration of topics
- Documentation includes clear usage examples
- Performance is acceptable for large document collections

## Additional Context

Topic modeling will help answer questions like:
- What are the main themes in current legislation?
- How do topics trend over time?
- Which bills are related by topic?
- What issues is each legislator focused on?

Example topics might include: "healthcare reform", "environmental protection", "tax policy", "education funding", etc.
