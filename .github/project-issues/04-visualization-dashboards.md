# [OpenDiscourse] Create Visualization Dashboards

**Project Item Category**: Short Term

**Priority**: High

**Estimated Effort**: Large (> 2 weeks)

## Description

Build interactive dashboards to visualize analysis results, trends, and patterns. This will make the data accessible to non-technical users and provide powerful exploration tools for researchers and journalists.

## Tasks

- [ ] Evaluate visualization frameworks (Plotly Dash, Streamlit, React + D3.js)
- [ ] Choose framework and set up project structure
- [ ] Create bill similarity network visualization
- [ ] Build voting pattern heatmaps (legislators x issues)
- [ ] Add sentiment trend charts over time
- [ ] Implement legislator comparison tools
- [ ] Create topic distribution visualizations
- [ ] Add filtering and search capabilities
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] Add export functionality (PDF, CSV, images)
- [ ] Deploy dashboard application
- [ ] Create user documentation and tutorials

## Dependencies

**Option 1: Python-based (Recommended for MVP)**
- `plotly` and `dash` - interactive visualizations
- `dash-bootstrap-components` - styling
- `pandas` - data manipulation

**Option 2: React-based (Better for production)**
- React, TypeScript
- D3.js or Recharts for visualizations
- Material-UI or Ant Design for components

**Backend API**
- FastAPI or Flask for data endpoints
- PostgreSQL connection for live data

## Success Criteria

- Dashboard loads and displays data from database
- All major analysis results are visualized
- Interactive features work smoothly
- Performance is acceptable with large datasets
- Dashboard is accessible and intuitive
- Documentation covers all features
- Deployment is automated and reliable

## Additional Context

Key visualizations to include:
1. **Bill Similarity Network**: Force-directed graph showing related bills
2. **Voting Heatmap**: Grid showing legislator votes on key issues
3. **Sentiment Timeline**: Line chart of sentiment trends over time
4. **Topic Distribution**: Bar chart or treemap of bill topics
5. **Legislator Comparison**: Radar chart comparing voting patterns
6. **Geographic View**: Map showing legislation by state/district
7. **Consistency Score**: Gauge showing individual consistency metrics

Consider hosting options:
- Heroku (easy deployment)
- AWS/GCP (scalable)
- GitHub Pages (static frontend)
- Streamlit Cloud (for Streamlit apps)
