# [OpenDiscourse] Advanced Network Analysis

**Project Item Category**: Long Term

**Priority**: Medium

**Estimated Effort**: Large (> 2 weeks)

## Description

Implement sophisticated network analysis for legislator relationships and bill co-sponsorship patterns. This will reveal informal power structures, coalition patterns, and influence networks within legislative bodies.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add NetworkX library integration
- [ ] Build co-sponsorship network analysis module
- [ ] Implement community detection algorithms (Louvain, Label Propagation)
- [ ] Add centrality metrics (betweenness, eigenvector, PageRank)
- [ ] Create influence and power index calculations
- [ ] Build voting bloc identification
- [ ] Implement temporal network analysis (evolution over time)
- [ ] Add network visualization tools (interactive graphs)
- [ ] Create database schema for network data
- [ ] Implement bipartite networks (legislators-bills)
- [ ] Add committee membership network analysis
- [ ] Build cross-party collaboration metrics
- [ ] Create network analysis API endpoints
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation

## Dependencies

- `networkx` - Network analysis library
- `python-louvain` - Community detection
- `graph-tool` or `igraph` - High-performance options
- Visualization: D3.js, Cytoscape.js, or Gephi export
- Database: Graph database (Neo4j) or PostgreSQL with relationships
- `plotly` or similar for interactive visualizations

## Success Criteria

- Networks accurately represent legislative relationships
- Community detection identifies real political blocs
- Centrality metrics align with known power structures
- Visualization is clear and interactive
- Performance scales to full Congress (535+ nodes)
- Temporal analysis shows meaningful trends
- API provides network data efficiently
- Documentation includes interpretation guide

## Additional Context

Network types to analyze:

1. **Co-sponsorship Network**
   - Nodes: Legislators
   - Edges: Co-sponsorship of bills
   - Weight: Number of bills co-sponsored together

2. **Voting Agreement Network**
   - Nodes: Legislators
   - Edges: Voting agreement rate
   - Weight: % of votes in agreement

3. **Committee Network**
   - Nodes: Legislators
   - Edges: Shared committee membership

4. **Bill-Legislator Bipartite Network**
   - Two node types: Bills and Legislators
   - Edges: Sponsorship, voting

Centrality metrics:
- **Degree**: Number of connections (influence breadth)
- **Betweenness**: Bridge between groups (brokerage power)
- **Eigenvector**: Connected to well-connected nodes (influence quality)
- **PageRank**: Overall importance in network

Community detection insights:
- Identify voting blocs beyond party lines
- Find bipartisan coalitions
- Track faction emergence and dissolution
- Predict future alliances

Example analysis questions:
- Who are the most influential legislators?
- Which coalitions form across party lines?
- How do networks change after elections?
- Who acts as bridges between parties?
- Which legislators are isolated or peripheral?

Visualization features:
- Force-directed layout
- Color by party or community
- Node size by centrality
- Edge thickness by relationship strength
- Time slider for temporal evolution
