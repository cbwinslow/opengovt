# [OpenDiscourse] Add Argument Mining Capabilities

**Project Item Category**: Medium Term

**Priority**: Medium

**Estimated Effort**: Large (> 2 weeks)

## Description

Implement argument mining to extract claims, premises, and reasoning from legislative texts. This will enable analysis of argumentation structures, identification of supporting/opposing arguments, and tracking of reasoning patterns in political discourse.

## Tasks

- [ ] Research argument mining frameworks and models
- [ ] Implement claim detection in legislative text
- [ ] Build premise identification module
- [ ] Add conclusion extraction
- [ ] Implement premise-conclusion linking
- [ ] Create argument structure representation (ADU trees)
- [ ] Add support/attack relation classification
- [ ] Build argumentation visualization tools
- [ ] Create database tables for argument structures
- [ ] Implement argument search and retrieval
- [ ] Add example scripts and documentation
- [ ] Evaluate on annotated legislative text

## Dependencies

- Argument mining models (potentially custom fine-tuned)
- `spacy` (already installed) for preprocessing
- Graph database or relational schema for arguments
- Annotation tools for evaluation corpus
- Visualization library (NetworkX, D3.js)

## Success Criteria

- System can identify argumentative components in bills
- Claims and premises are correctly extracted
- Argument structures are logically represented
- Relationships between arguments are identified
- Visualization clearly shows argument flow
- Database schema efficiently stores argument data
- API allows querying by argument type or topic
- Documentation includes argument mining examples

## Additional Context

Argument mining components:
1. **Argumentative Discourse Units (ADUs)**: Claims, premises, evidence
2. **Relations**: Support, attack, rebuttal
3. **Schemes**: Argumentation patterns (e.g., appeal to authority, cause-effect)

Use cases:
- Identify pro/con arguments for specific legislation
- Track how arguments evolve across bill versions
- Find counter-arguments from opposing parties
- Analyze quality of evidence cited
- Compare argumentation strategies

Example structure:
```
Bill H.R. 1234: "Healthcare Reform Act"

Claim: "This bill will reduce healthcare costs"
  ├─ Premise: "Current system is inefficient"
  │   └─ Evidence: "Administrative costs are 25% of spending"
  └─ Premise: "Competition will lower prices"
      └─ Evidence: "Studies show markets reduce costs by 15%"
```
