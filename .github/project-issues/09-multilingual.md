# [OpenDiscourse] Multi-lingual Support

**Project Item Category**: Long Term

**Priority**: Low

**Estimated Effort**: Large (> 2 weeks)

## Description

Extend analysis capabilities to support multiple languages for international legislative bodies. This will enable OpenDiscourse to analyze legislation from non-English speaking countries and provide comparative analysis across nations.

## Tasks

- [ ] Identify target languages (Spanish, French, German, etc.)
- [ ] Add multi-lingual NLP models (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa)
- [ ] Implement translation services integration (Google Translate API, DeepL)
- [ ] Update database schema for language field
- [ ] Add language-specific tokenization and preprocessing
- [ ] Adapt sentiment analysis for each language
- [ ] Update entity extraction for multi-lingual support
- [ ] Create language-specific embedding models
- [ ] Add language detection functionality
- [ ] Update API to support language parameter
- [ ] Create documentation for each supported language
- [ ] Build language-specific test suites
- [ ] Add UI language switcher (if applicable)

## Dependencies

- `transformers` with multi-lingual models
- Translation API (Google, DeepL, or Azure)
- Language-specific spaCy models
- `langdetect` or similar for language identification
- Multi-lingual sentiment analysis models
- Updated database schema

## Success Criteria

- System supports at least 3 major languages
- Analysis accuracy comparable to English
- Language detection is accurate (>95%)
- Translation quality is acceptable
- API handles multiple languages seamlessly
- Documentation exists for each language
- Performance impact is minimal
- Cost of translation services is reasonable

## Additional Context

Target languages by priority:
1. **Spanish**: US Latino communities, Latin American countries
2. **French**: Canada, France, francophone Africa
3. **German**: Germany, Austria, Switzerland
4. **Chinese**: Taiwan, Singapore
5. **Portuguese**: Brazil, Portugal

Challenges:
- Idiomatic expressions in politics
- Cultural context in sentiment analysis
- Legal terminology variations
- Entity recognition in non-Latin scripts
- Right-to-left language support (Arabic)

Example use cases:
- Compare healthcare policies across EU countries
- Track environmental legislation globally
- Analyze immigration debates in multiple languages
- Study democratic processes worldwide

Multi-lingual models:
- **mBERT**: Covers 104 languages
- **XLM-RoBERTa**: Better performance, 100 languages
- **spaCy**: Language-specific models available
- **fastText**: Multi-lingual word embeddings
