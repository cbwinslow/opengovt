## üéØ Purpose

This research supports the development of **OpenDiscourse.net**, a comprehensive platform for political transparency and analysis. The goal is to:

1. **Understand Political Behavior**: Use data science to analyze politician statements, votes, and positions
2. **Measure Consistency**: Track position changes over time and identify flip-flops
3. **Detect Bias**: Identify political bias and loaded language in communications
4. **Analyze Impact**: Measure how politicians influence their constituents and vice versa
5. **Track Transparency**: Evaluate openness and accountability metrics
6. **Monitor Social Media**: Analyze Twitter/social media engagement and sentiment
7. **Inform Citizens**: Provide data-driven insights accessible to all

## üî¨ Methodology

Our approach combines multiple disciplines:

- **Big Data Analytics**: Processing millions of documents, tweets, and votes
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding meaning and sentiment in political text
- **Machine Learning**: Training models to detect patterns and make predictions
- **Vector Databases**: Enabling semantic search across political documents
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Measuring emotional tone and public response
- **Network Analysis**: Understanding relationships and influence patterns
- **Time Series Analysis**: Tracking changes and trends over time

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Covered

- **SQL Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Vector Databases**: pgvector, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus
- **NLP Libraries**: spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Embeddings Models**: sentence-transformers, BERT, RoBERTa, GPT
- **Sentiment Analysis**: VADER, TextBlob, DistilBERT
- **Social Media APIs**: Twitter/X API v2, Facebook Graph API
- **Visualization**: D3.js, Plotly, Tableau
- **Frameworks**: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow

## üìä Key Metrics Framework

### Entity Metrics (Per Politician)
- **Bias Score**: -1 (left) to +1 (right)
- **Consistency Score**: 0-100% (voting record alignment)
- **Transparency Index**: 0-100% (disclosure and accessibility)
- **Toxicity Level**: 0-1 (hate speech and inflammatory language)
- **Impact Score**: Measured influence on constituent opinions
- **Engagement Rate**: Social media interaction levels
- **Sentiment Score**: Public perception (-1 to +1)

### Document Metrics (Per Bill/Statement)
- **Readability Score**: Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG index
- **Complexity Score**: Lexical diversity, sentence length
- **Partisan Language**: Loaded terms and framing analysis
- **Topic Classification**: Issue categorization
- **Similarity Score**: Comparison to other documents
- **Entity Mentions**: Key people, organizations, locations

### Social Media Metrics
- **Tweet Sentiment**: Positive/Negative/Neutral classification
- **Reply Sentiment**: Constituent response tone
- **Engagement**: Likes, retweets, replies, quote tweets
- **Reach**: Impressions and audience size
- **Virality**: Spread rate and network effects
- **Bot Ratio**: Estimated fake vs. real engagement
